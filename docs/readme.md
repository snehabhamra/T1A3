T1A3 - 'The Forgotten: GOTY Edition' 

This is a choose-your-own-adventure text based game I developed through Ruby. 

This is the final (as of now) edition of this game, and may be played if you have Ruby installed by typing in game.rb in Terminal.

PURPOSE

"The Forgotten" A choose-your-own-adventure horror game, I developed this text-based application with the intent of exploring the creative avenues early developers would engage with to make the most of computer gaming during an era where videogames were still largely unheard of. The game is fairly simple and short, and entails the journey of an amnesiac main character who must explore and escape from a decrepit mansion they are trapped within. A multi-linear story, the player has the choice to alter their routes through the otherwise fixed text game, when presented with multi-choice decisions. An inventory system exists to assist the player in their journey when finding special items, and a karma meter is in place which will decrease depending on player actions - once the karma meter hits 0 the game will automatically face a specific ending. In total, there are four endings which may be achieved. 

This game is being developed as my first project while studying Ruby. As an avid gamer myself, being able to explore the intersection between creativity and functionality in games development is something I am particularly excited about, hence the fruition of this project. 

This game is targeted at those above the age of 16 and beyond - as a horror title, some themes explored, while briefly, would not be recommended for anybody below that age. In particular I would highly recommend this title to other budding developers and programmers, as it would afford them the opportunity to explore an amateur game application made using Ruby. I intend for this application to be utilised for both educational and recreational purposes - I would hope it be considered enjoyable enough as a standalone text game, but simultaneously also be shown as an example of the sort of process a developer may engage in to create a product on their own.

FEATURES

The key features of this text-based game are its inventory system, main menu and multi-linear game paths/endings.

The inventory system is a key facet of many videogames regardless of genre. In this horror game, the player will have the opportunity to find and use key items depending on the choices they make, which would unlock different endings or provide a different route through the game providing greater insight on the story or environment. This feature has been implemented through the use of classes.

A main-menu system at the beginning of the game when first run is another primary feature I have worked on implementing in the game. Providing a bit more structure and finality to the game, the menu offers the player the choice to begin the game, or to view the rules and
