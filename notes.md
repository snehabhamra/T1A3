#programming : giving instructions to the computer to perform certain task 
#pseudocode: giving instructions in english
#binary: 01
#higher level languages:
ruby, python, c, c#, java
#we need a translator to convert higher level languages to binary so the computer may understand
#translator:
compiler and interpreter are the most common translators
- compiler is mainly used for c, c# (videogames), java (back-end) and takes all the code and converts all the binary at once
- interpretor is mainly used for ruby, javascript, python, typescript and interprets the code line by line, executing and translating each code to binary rather than providing a "compiled" summary like compiler. 

#Web Dev Languages - js, ruby, php, python, typescript, go, c# rust
- Javascript has many versions which allow for both front end and back end web development (React, node js, vanilla, vue, angular, react native etc.)

#Why Ruby:
- beginner friendly
- huge toolset - ruby on rails - quickly build web app
- Backend programming, only works in terminal and on the server, not in the browser. It requires HTML and CSS as it does not function in the browser.

In Ruby, everything is an object. Every bit of information and code can be given their own properties and actions. Object-oriented programming calls properties by the name instance variables and actions are known as methods. Rubyâ€™s pure object-oriented approach is most commonly demonstrated by a bit of code which applies an action to a number.

Ruby datatypes: numbers - integers (whole number) and floats (decimal). Booleon (true/false), symbols (: _), string (characters, ")

To run a command requiring a response which has a decimal, you need to convert the command to a float. 
    e.g. 3/2 = 1.5 but ruby will say 1 unless we type 3/2.to_f, which would give 1.5
        one of the operants need to be a floating value if you want the outcome to be a floating variable
        escaping sequence - back slash \

RUBY variables are memory locations which can be accessed by putitng a hash chnaracter just before the varible or constant.

3 types of naming conventions - 
sceaming_snake_case for methods and variables
snake_case 
camel_case for classes amd modules


never hard code values, use variables
